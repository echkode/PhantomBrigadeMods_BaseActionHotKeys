# BaseActionHotKeys

A configuration mod for [Phantom Brigade (Alpha)](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/) that restores the hotkeys for the cruise/stealth/overdrive movement modes in the overworld map.

Patch 0.23.1-b5426 made some changes to the input system to allow key rebinding which is great. Unfortunately, a few config file changes needed to match the code changes didn't make it into the release. But that's what the experimental releases are for, to test out and catch things like this.

I've made a release which simply bundles up the files in this repository into a zip file to make it easier to download it all. See this [detailed guide](https://github.com/NBKRedSpy/PB_EquipmentTypeRarity#installation) about how to enable and install mods in Phantom Brigade.
